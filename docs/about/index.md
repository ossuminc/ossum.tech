# About Ossum Inc.

**Ossum Inc.** builds tools that make designing distributed systems accessible
to domain experts—not just seasoned architects.

---

## Our Mission

Complex software systems are hard to build. The gap between what business
experts understand and what developers implement is where projects fail.
Requirements get lost in translation, designs drift from intent, and systems
end up solving yesterday's problems.

We believe there's a better way.

**RIDDL** (Reactive Interface to Domain Definition Language) bridges this gap
by providing a specification language that domain experts can read and
contribute to, while being precise enough for AI-assisted code generation.
It's Domain-Driven Design made practical.

## The Story

RIDDL began in 2019, born from decades of experience building large-scale
distributed systems. After watching project after project struggle with the
same problems—miscommunication between business and technical teams, designs
that couldn't keep up with changing requirements, implementations that drifted
from specifications—founder Reid Spencer started asking: *What if the
specification itself was the source of truth?*

The first commits landed in late 2021. Reactific Software LLC, the original
home of RIDDL, was acquired by Ossum Inc. in 2022 to continue the vision:
making distributed system design accessible to everyone who understands the
domain, not just those who can write code.
