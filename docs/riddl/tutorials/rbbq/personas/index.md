# Reactive BBQ Personas

The Reactive BBQ case study includes interviews with key personnel that
inform the domain model. Each interview reveals challenges and requirements
that shape how we model the system in RIDDL.

## Executive & Corporate

- [CEO](ceo.md) - Overall business challenges, system reliability issues,
  and strategic vision for the technology refresh
- [Corporate Head Chef](head-chef.md) - Menu management, recipe
  distribution, and coordination with marketing

## Front of House

- [Host](host.md) - Reservation management and seating guests
- [Server](server.md) - Order taking, food delivery, and payment processing
- [Bartender](bartender.md) - Drink orders and bar service

## Kitchen

- [Chef](chef.md) - Kitchen oversight, order management, and local sourcing
- [Cook](cook.md) - Food preparation at various stations

## Delivery & Online

Each persona interview follows a consistent format:

1. **Role description** - What does this person do?
2. **Challenges** - What problems do they face with the current system?
3. **Key details** - Summary of requirements extracted from the interview

These interviews provide the domain knowledge needed to build an accurate
RIDDL model of the Reactive BBQ system.
