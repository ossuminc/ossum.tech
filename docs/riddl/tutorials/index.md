description: "A tutorial guide to RIDDL with the Reactive BBQ"
---

Some people can learn RIDDL faster by looking at examples than they can by
reading the informal definitions in the
[language reference](../references/language-reference.md) or the
formal definitions in the
[EBNF grammar](../references/ebnf-grammar.md).
To support that mode of learning, this tutorial decomposes the domain of a
fictitious restaurant, The Reactive BBQ.

As you will see, the Reactive BBQ is an expansive domain. As such, this
tutorial will not attempt to have you specify the entire domain. Rather, we
will work through each feature of the RIDDL language by considering examples
from inside the Reactive BBQ domain. We have fully specified it so that you
have a concrete reference implementation and the companion language
references to guide you.
