# Overview
This section contains various RIDDL reference manuals to help you learn and use
RIDDL. Reference manuals are concise and technical. They are intended for AI
to learn the details of RIDDL and may only be useful to a subset of the RIDDL
user community. The current set of references are:

* [Language Reference](language-reference.md) - a detailed description of the structure and 
  allowed syntax of RIDDL models. 
* [EBNF Grammar](ebnf-grammar.md) - a formal EBNF grammar for the RIDDL language so AI can
  accurately construct RIDDL models.
