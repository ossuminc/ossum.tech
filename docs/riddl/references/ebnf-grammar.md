# Formal EBNF Grammar

Below is the formal Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar for RIDDL.
This grammar provides a precise definition of RIDDL syntax and can be used as a
reference when constructing valid RIDDL expressions. This grammar is
automatically extracted from the `riddl-language` library and kept in sync
with the reference grammar written in Scala/fastparse form.
