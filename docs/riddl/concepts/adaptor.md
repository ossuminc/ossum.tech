title: "Adaptor"

An adaptor's purpose is to _adapt_ one [Context](context.md)
to another [Context](context.md).  In Domain-Driven Design, 
this concept is known as an _anti-corruption layer_ that keeps the 
ubiquitous language of one context "corrupting" the language of another 
context.  The authors of RIDDL didn't like that term for a variety of reasons
so we have renamed the concept as _adaptor_ in RIDDL. Same idea, different name.

## Message Translation
Adaptors do their work at the level of messages sent between 
[Contexts](context.md). This is done using one or 
more [Handlers]( handler.md ). Each handler specifies 
how messages are translated into other messages and forwarded to the target 
[context](context.md).   

## Target Context
Adaptors are only definable within a containing 
[Context](context.md) which provides one participant of the 
translation. The other [Context](context.md), known as the 
*target* context, is specified within the definition of the adaptor. 

## Adaptation Directionality
Adaptors only translate in one direction, between the containing context and 
the target context. However, multiple Adaptors can be defined 
to achieve bidirectional adaptation between
[Contexts](context.md). 
The directionality of an Adaptor is specified in the definition of the adaptor.
This leads to two kinds of adaptors: inbound and outbound.

## Inbound Adaptors
Inbound adaptors provide an adaptation that occurs from the 
[Context](context.md) referenced in the adaptor to the
[Context](context.md) containing the adaptor. 

## Outbound Adaptors
Outbound adaptors provide an adaptation that occurs from the
[Context](context.md) containing the adaptor to the
[Context](context.md) referenced in the adaptor.
