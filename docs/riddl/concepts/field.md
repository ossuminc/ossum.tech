Fields are the unit of composition of an aggregate type, state, or 
projection. A field is a simple mapping of a name to a type. For example:

```name: Number```

specifies that the field named `name` has type `Number`. Fields are most often
referenced in [conditionals](conditional.md) to supply 
the values over which truthiness is computed.
