title: "Vital Definitions"
draft: false
---

Not all definitions are equal. The RIDDL language considers some definitions
to be more important than others, and we call these "vital definitions". You
can recognize a vital definition because they all have
[Statements](statement.md) somewhere in their definitional
hierarchy. Statements define behavior of a definition. Vital definitions are
also the only ones permitted to reference an
[Author](author.md).

These are the vital definitions:

* [Adaptors](adaptor.md)
* [Contexts](context.md)
* [Domains](domain.md)
* [Entities](entity.md)
* [Epics](epic.md)
* [Functions](function.md)
* [Projectors](projector.md)
* [Repositories](repository.md)
* [Sagas](saga.md)
* [Streamlets](streamlet.md)
