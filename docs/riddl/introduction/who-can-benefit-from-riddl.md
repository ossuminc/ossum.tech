RIDDL is technology-agnostic, but not design-agnostic. It is purposefully 
aimed at the design of large scale, distributed systems based on a 
reactive architecture. RIDDL allows specification of the design of a system, 
without regard to programming language, cloud vendor choice, or specific 
technology choices. Using RIDDL allows a living design to evolve through
every stage of the development process and then through continuing
maintenance and evolution of the system designed.

Consequently, the people who can benefit from RIDDL are software development
teams that want a precise and consistent way of specifying their evolving
design as a guide to all stakeholders. RIDDL aims to support such teams with
productivity increases by:

* Keeping documentation in sync with the design—no more stale wikis
* Providing structured context that AI tools can use to generate accurate code
* Enabling iterative refinement from high-level concepts to detailed specs
* Creating a single source of truth that all stakeholders can reference
