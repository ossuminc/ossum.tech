RIDDL gets its name from an acronym that stands for *Reactive Interface* for
*Domain Definition Language*.

RIDDL is specification language for the niche of large, distributed,
reactive, concurrent systems such as required for modern internet-scale 
applications or corporate back office infrastructure. 

RIDDL is an open source project that provides a variety of software libraries
provided by [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ossuminc/riddl). That repository also 
provides a compiler for processing RIDDL specifications, `riddlc`. For more details, 
please see the [tools section](../tools/riddlc/index.md).
