RIDDL gets its name from an acronym: *Reactive Interface to Domain Definition
Language*.

RIDDL is a specification language for large, distributed, reactive systems—the
kind you need for modern internet-scale applications or corporate back-office
infrastructure.

It's an open source project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ossuminc/riddl),
which provides the language specification, supporting libraries, and a compiler
called `riddlc`. For more details, see the [tools section](../tools/riddlc/index.md).
