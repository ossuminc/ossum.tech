# Tools

There are several tools for working with RIDDL models:

## [riddlc](riddlc/index.md)

The RIDDL compiler (`riddlc`) is the command-line tool for parsing and
validating RIDDL models. It can:

- Validate syntax and semantics
- Output analysis reports

Documentation and diagram generation will be available through
[Synapify](../../synapify/index.md).

## [riddl-idea-plugin](riddl-idea-plugin/index.md)

An IntelliJ IDEA plugin (2024.3+) that provides IDE support for editing RIDDL
files, including syntax highlighting, validation, and navigation.

## [riddl-mcp-server](riddl-mcp-server/index.md)

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with RIDDL
language intelligence, enabling AI-assisted model authoring.

## Synapify

A desktop application for visual RIDDL modeling with AI assistance. Synapify
provides a graphical interface for creating and editing RIDDL models, with
integrated AI support for generating definitions.

See the [Synapify Section](../../synapify/index.md) for more details.

## VS Code Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension for RIDDL editing. Provides syntax highlighting
and basic language support for VS Code users.

See the [riddl-vscode repository](https://github.com/ossuminc/riddl-vscode)
