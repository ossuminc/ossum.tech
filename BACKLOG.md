# BACKLOG

The single place for open work on ossum.tech. If it is not here, it is not
tracked. Completed items leave this file: what they taught goes to NOTEBOOK.md,
what is durably true goes to CLAUDE.md.

## 1a-remnant. `repository CartRepository` cannot be gated as written

**What:** One fence on `references/language-reference.md` still carries a
skip that is *not* a content bug. Its schema names `record Cart`, while the
page prelude must supply `entity Cart` for other fences on the page. One
context cannot hold both names, and `no-prelude=Cart` withdraws the entity
without providing the record.

**Fixing it** means renaming the prelude's `entity Cart` and every fence that
reaches it — bigger than it looks, and worth doing only if that page's
vocabulary is being reworked anyway. Everything else 1a-followup listed is
fixed (commit `470b436`).

**Not urgent:** the fence is a skip with an honest reason, so nothing is red.

## 1b. Gate the doc trees that have no directives at all  ← START HERE

**What:** Not yet gated: `tutorials/rbbq/` (30 pages, the most-read tree),
`guides/`, `tools/`, and the `riddlg`/`synapify`/`shell` sites.

**17 blanket skips live in these trees** and are the natural first slice:
`migration/1.x-to-2.0.md` (6), `guides/authors/design/command-event-patterns.md`
(6), `guides/authors/design/ui-modeling.md` (3), `guides/authors/index.md` (2).
They are the last of the original 118. These trees also carry 4 pre-existing
failures, so starting here means going red before green -- gate a page at a
time.

**Also open:** `check-riddl-blocks.py` flags 33 advisory items, all in
`migration/` (which shows 1.x deliberately — arguably belongs in EXEMPT_PATHS)
and `tutorials/rbbq/`.

**Order:** this is now the top of the list.

## 2. Promote RIDDL 2.0 to `latest` when it ships final

**What:** `latest` points at 1.31, which is correct while 2.0 is an RC.

**How:** `scripts/promote-2.0-to-latest.md`. Since TASK G it is **one commit** —
both RIDDL lines publish from `main`, so the old two-branches-one-alias landmine
is gone.

**The one rule left:** `mike set-default` runs once per entry, so the **last
`riddl` entry** in `docs-version.yml` decides where `/riddl/` redirects. Move
the entries, not just the alias.

**Blocked on:** RIDDL 2.0 final. `../bin/riddlc` is `2.0.0-rc.10-57-e012ebb9`
(verified 2026-08-10); do not trust a version written here, run it.

---

## 3. Re-sync the EBNF grammar whenever riddl's parser changes

**What:** `sites/riddl/docs/references/riddl-grammar.ebnf` is **generated** from
the riddl version pinned in `build.sbt`. It moves often while 2.0 is in RC.

**Do this, always:**
```bash
# 1. set build.sbt's With.Riddl.library(version = ...) to match `riddlc version`
# 2. then
sbt extractGrammar
```

The pin and `../bin/riddlc` must name the SAME version, or the docs describe a
grammar the validated examples were never checked against. Bumping the pin may
require bumping `With.Scala3` to whatever riddl built with.

**Never `cp` it from `../riddl`.** That is a live working tree. Verified
2026-08-08: it held an uncommitted `yields`/`replies` split that exists in no
commit and no build, so a copy would have documented a language that does not
exist, and looked successful. See CLAUDE.md § "Things that will bite".

The file is generated wholesale, so partial syncs are not an option — expect
unrelated rules to come along.

**When:** Any time riddl restages `../bin/riddlc`. Compare `riddlc version`
against the pin in `build.sbt` at session start.

## 4. Watch for `requires type T` in prose

**What:** Low priority, informational. `requires <type_ref>` accepts an
**optional** `type` keyword — `aggregate_use_case = "type" | "command" |
"query" | ...` (`ebnf-grammar.ebnf`), confirmed by riddl 2026-08-04 and by
compiling both spellings.

**Why it is here:** This session briefly believed `requires type T` was invalid,
having misread `type_ref = [aggregate_use_case] path_identifier` as excluding
the keyword. The docs use the bare form, which is correct — but do not "fix"
anyone who writes `requires type T`, and do not assert it is wrong.

---

## 5. Site and content roadmap (was buried in NOTEBOOK.md)

**What:** 18 site/content items that had been recorded in NOTEBOOK.md's
"Deferred Strategic Improvements" and "Lower Priority" tables. Moved here
2026-08-10 because NOTEBOOK is the narrative record and BACKLOG is the tracked
one — an item living only in NOTEBOOK is not tracked.

**Not verified.** Unlike items 1-4, these were carried over as written and none
was re-checked against the current site. Treat priorities as stale until
confirmed; several predate the per-product versioning migration.
